``Multi-property regression imp-db.ipnyb``: The jupyter notebook for building extra trees, random forest and deep neural networks regression models for the imputed database and comparing the **MAE** of the models to determine the best multi-property regression model with lowest MAE (**Extra Trees**).

``Multi-property model results.xlsx``: The exported excel file of performance metrics of the multi-property models built on the imputed database.

The below figure shows the performance of the chosen multi-property model on the training and testing data sets of the imputed database.
